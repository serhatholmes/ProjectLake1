Quick Reference - Simple Spin Blur

Configuration Steps:
1. Select the mesh on which spin blur needs to be applied
2. Create a material and set the standard shader rendering mode to Fade
3. Rotate your object with a simple script and adjust the Simple Spin Blur script properties to get the desired affect
4. All the properties of the script can be edited in real time by calling the Simple Spin Blur class [ssb = GetComponent<SimpleSpinBlur>()]

This project is still an ongoing topic of research. Rotational/Radial Motion Vectors do exist but have not been incorporated into the game engines readily.
Would be great to hear any ideas or improvements to this technique from the Unity3D community in the forum or via mail.
A kind review would be much appreciated and would also help us support this asset free of cost.

If you have any questions, issues or suggestions we are always there at info@aikodex.com to answer to them.
